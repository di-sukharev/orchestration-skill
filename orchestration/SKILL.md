name: orchestration
description: >-
  Deliver a complete implementation through one planning and implementing
  subagent and fresh reviewing subagents, guided by a lead.
  Use when the user requests an orchestration workflow.
---

## Roles and rules

You are the lead. You assign work and judge reports.
Subagents read project files, write code, and run checks; you do not.
Do not read subagent histories. Spawn every subagent yourself; no nested delegation.

Use the user's chosen model for all subagents. Defaults: `gpt-5.6-luna` in Codex,
`sonnet` in Claude Code. Set it on every spawn. If unavailable, report it; do not substitute.
Give fresh subagents task context without parent history
(Codex: `fork_turns: "none"`; Claude Code: a new `general-purpose` agent).

- Meet all requirements with the simplest sufficient solution. Keep UX thoughtful,
  simple, and elegant, and UI minimal. Avoid unnecessary clicks, modals, and controls.
  Give these expectations to every subagent.
- Do not open a browser or click through the app for visual inspection.
  Work from code and check results. The user checks the visuals.
- Subagents run useful checks and those required by the project. Skip unrelated
  or redundant checks; reuse valid results. Fix task-caused failures, report unrelated ones.
- Respect project instructions, user overrides, and unrelated work.

## Plan and implement

1. You start a fresh implementing subagent with the task, requirements, and constraints.
   It reads the code and proposes a plan, edge cases, and checks.
2. You check that the plan covers requirements, keeps UX/UI simple, and explains
   verification. Ask open-ended questions only if uncertainty about assumptions,
   risks, or verification affects your decision. The subagent investigates.
   If the plan is sound, tell it to proceed.
3. The same subagent completes the task, one subtask at a time.
   No intermediate approvals or commits. It runs suitable checks before reporting.
4. It reports requirements met, decisions, code references, check results,
   and uncertainties. You assess the evidence. Return incomplete work or
   unanswered material concerns to the same subagent.

## Review and fix

5. You start a fresh reviewing subagent with the original requirements, accepted
   clarifications, task scope, repository path, check results, and known risks.
   Do not give it previous review conclusions.
6. It reviews all current task changes, including new files, and affected code.
   It looks beyond the risks you named and keeps reviewing after finding an issue.
   Before editing, it reports material defects and DX problems caused or worsened
   by this task. Each finding explains the failing scenario, violated requirement,
   code location, impact, why existing safeguards fail, reproduction or a regression
   test, and the smallest fix with its effects. It separates facts, assumptions,
   and important gaps in the review.
7. You judge the findings. Accept concrete problems supported by evidence.
   Reject unsupported claims, personal preferences, and scope expansion with reasons.
   Weigh impact and likelihood without inventing probabilities.
   Ask open-ended questions only if uncertainty about the evidence, consequences,
   or proposed fix prevents a decision. The same subagent investigates.
8. You tell that reviewing subagent to fix accepted findings.
   Where practical, it writes a failing regression test, fixes the bug, and verifies
   the result. It runs suitable checks before reporting back.
9. After fixes, you start a fresh subagent to review all updated task changes.
   Any later change to the reviewed scope needs review too.
   Finish when accepted findings and important review gaps are resolved,
   and applicable checks pass.

## Finish

Resolve obstacles inside the current task, then continue.
Pause only when human action is needed; say what is needed.
Commit, push, deploy, or change production data only with user authorization.
Brief subagents in English. Finish in the user's language with results,
checks, and remaining issues.
